# Dropbox-Stencil

To use this code you need the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) package. You should install it using pip with `python3 -m pip install cryptography`. 

You should also use `python3`.

To run the stencil, run `python3 stencil.py`. This will not do anything but should not throw errors.

To test the crypto library, run `python3 -m support.crypto` which also should not throw errors.
